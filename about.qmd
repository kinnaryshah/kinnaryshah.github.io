In collaboration with [Dr. Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com) and researchers at the Lieber Institute for Brain Development, I am currently working on spatial transcriptomics methods development and data analysis projects.

I recently gave a talk about my project characterizing the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex by integrating spatially-resolved transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data at the STATGEN conference in May 2025 - pictured below. This preprint will be available shortly!

I presented one of my projects at the BioConductor conference in August 2023. Feel free to watch it here (0:40-10:22)!

We recently preprinted this project on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.04.621867v2).

Finally, if you'd like to read my first research project ever, click [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6553526/)! We used Oxford Nanpore sequencing to characterize adenine methylation in *Drosophila*.
