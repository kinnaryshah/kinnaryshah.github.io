My name is Kinnary (kin-uh-ree) Shah, and I am working on my PhD at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the Department of Biostatistics. I received my Bachelor's degree in Biomathematics & Public Health from Rutgers University - New Brunswick, where I completed research projects in computational genetics and public policy. Outside of academics, I enjoy experimenting in the kitchen and hand building slab pottery.
