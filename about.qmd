In collaboration with Dr. Stephanie Hicks and researchers at the Lieber Institute for Brain Development, I am currently working on spatial transcriptomics methods development and data analysis projects.

I presented one of my projects at the BioConductor conference in August 2023. Feel free to watch it here (0:40-10:22)!

We recently preprinted this project on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.04.621867v2).
