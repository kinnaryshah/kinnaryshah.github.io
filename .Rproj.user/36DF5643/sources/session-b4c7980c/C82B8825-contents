In collaboration with Dr. Stephanie Hicks and researchers at the Lieber Institute for Brain Development, I am currently working on spatial transcriptomics methods development and data analysis projects.

I will be attending my first in-person conference in August 2023! I am excited to present my methods work as a short talk at BioConductor.
